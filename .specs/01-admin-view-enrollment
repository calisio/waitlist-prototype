# Feature 1: Admin views current enrollment list for each program

## Description

Admin can view a list of all residents currently enrolled in a specific program, including enrollment details and program capacity information.

## User Flow

1. Admin sees a list of all programs
2. Admin clicks on a program
3. Admin is taken to a program detail page showing:
    - Program capacity (e.g., "15/30 spots filled")
    - List of currently enrolled residents
    - Waitlist (below enrollment list)

## Data Displayed - Enrolled Residents

For each enrolled resident, show:

-   Resident name
-   Resident ID number
-   Enrollment date (date they started the program)

## UI Requirements

-   Simple list view (no sorting/filtering in MVP)
-   Display enrollment list above waitlist on the same page
-   Program capacity clearly visible (X/Y format where Y is max capacity)
-   Max capacity range: 30-60 students per program

## Notes

-   Read-only view (no editing capability in this feature)
-   Completion/end dates not included in MVP
-   Additional resident attributes (housing unit, release date, etc.) deferred to future enhancement
