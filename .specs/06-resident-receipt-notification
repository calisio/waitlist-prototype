# Resident receives notification when admin confirms receipt

## Description

Resident receives an in-app notification when an admin confirms receipt of their kite request, providing transparency that their request has been seen.

## Notification System

-   In-app notifications only (no email/SMS in MVP)
-   Notifications displayed on a dedicated notifications page/inbox
-   Notifications are not immediate - populated when resident visits the page (when DB is queried)

## Notification Content

The notification should state:

-   "Your kite for [Program Name] has been acknowledged by an administrator"

No additional information, timestamps, or actions required from resident.

## User Experience

-   Resident navigates to notifications page to view all notifications
-   No manual marking as read/unread in MVP
-   No visual distinction between new and viewed notifications in MVP
-   All notifications appear with same styling
-   No actions required from resident (informational only)

## Business Rules

-   Notification created when admin confirms receipt of kite
-   Notifications do not expire or get archived
-   Notifications persist indefinitely (relates to notification history feature)

## Notes

-   Provides transparency to residents that their request was received
-   Sets expectation that their kite is being processed
-   Part of the trust-building workflow to replace opaque paper kite system

## Future Enhancements

-   Auto-mark notifications as viewed when scrolled into viewport
-   New notifications appear highlighted/bold, viewed notifications appear regular/gray
-   Visual distinction helps residents identify what's new at a glance
