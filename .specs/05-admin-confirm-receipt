# Admin confirms receipt of kite

## Description

Admin acknowledges that they have received and viewed a resident's kite request. This is the first step in processing a kite before approving it for the waitlist.

## User Flow

1. Admin views kite in the pending kites list
2. Admin clicks "Confirm Viewed" button on the kite
3. Status badge updates from "Pending" to "Confirmed"
4. Button changes to reflect next available action
5. Visual styling changes to indicate different state
6. Resident receives notification (separate feature)

## Action Details

-   **Button label**: "Confirm Viewed" (or similar simple language)
-   **Interaction**: Single click, no confirmation dialog needed
-   **Processing**: One kite at a time (no bulk actions)

## What Changes After Confirmation

-   Status badge updates: "Pending" â†’ "Confirmed"
-   Button changes to next action (approve/add to waitlist)
-   Visual styling updates to distinguish confirmed kites from pending ones
-   Kite remains in same position in the list (does not move or reorder)

## Business Rules

-   One-way action (cannot be undone/un-confirmed)
-   No additional input required from admin (just button click)
-   Triggers notification to resident that their kite was received

## UI Requirements

-   Clear visual distinction between pending and confirmed kites
-   Button state clearly indicates next available action after confirmation
-   Smooth transition without disrupting list order or admin's place in the workflow

## Notes

-   This acknowledgment step provides transparency to residents that their request was seen
-   Separates "we received your request" from "we're adding you to the waitlist"
-   Allows admin to batch-review kites before deciding on approvals
