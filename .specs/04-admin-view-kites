# Admin views received kites

## Description

Admin can view all pending kite requests for a specific program, allowing them to see and process incoming requests from residents who want to join the program's waitlist.

## Location & Layout

-   Displayed on the program detail page (same page as enrollment list and waitlist)
-   Positioned in a separate section on the right side of the page
-   Enrollment list and waitlist displayed on the left side
-   Prominent placement ensures admin sees and reviews pending kites

## Data Displayed - Pending Kites

For each kite, show:

-   Status badge (Pending or Confirmed)
-   Resident name
-   Resident ID number
-   Timestamp (when kite was submitted)
-   Optional note (if resident provided additional context)
-   Visual indicator for kites waiting 7+ days (badge/alert)

## Ordering & Organization

-   All kites displayed in a single list (not separated by status)
-   Kites displayed newest first (most recent at top)
-   All kites shown for the current program only
-   Sorted by timestamp descending

## Visual Indicators

-   Status badge shows current state: "Pending" or "Confirmed"
-   Kites older than 7 days display a warning badge/alert (e.g., "⚠️ 7 days old")
-   Helps prevent older requests from being forgotten

## Kite States

Kites in this view can be in two states:

-   **Pending**: Waiting for admin to confirm receipt
-   **Confirmed**: Admin has acknowledged receipt, waiting for approval/denial

Both states remain in the same list - status badge updates when admin confirms receipt.

## Business Rules

-   Only shows unprocessed kites (pending and confirmed)
-   Once kite is approved, it is removed from this section and resident appears on the waitlist
-   Once kite is denied, it is removed from this view
-   No history view in MVP (future enhancement)

## Actions Available

-   Admin can confirm receipt of kite
-   Admin can approve kite to add resident to waitlist
-   Process kites one at a time (no bulk actions in MVP)
-   Kite remains in same position in list when status changes from Pending to Confirmed

## Notes

-   Single list approach allows admin to process kite from start to finish without hunting between sections
-   This view is specific to each program (kites shown per program page)
-   Combines visibility with actionability - admin can see and act on kites in one place

## Future Enhancements to Consider

-   View history of processed kites (approved/denied)
-   Bulk confirmation actions
-   Filter by status (pending vs confirmed)
-   Deny/reject kite functionality
