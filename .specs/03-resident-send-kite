# Resident sends a kite

## Description

Resident can browse available programs and send a kite (request) to join a program's waitlist. The system captures their information and timestamp automatically.

## User Flow

1. Resident views a list of available programs
2. Resident finds a program they're interested in
3. Resident clicks a button to send a kite for that program
4. (Optional) Resident can include a note with additional context
5. System automatically captures: resident name, ID number, and timestamp
6. Resident sees confirmation that kite was sent successfully

## Data Captured

**Automatically captured:**

-   Resident name
-   Resident ID number
-   Timestamp (when button was clicked)

**Optional resident input:**

-   Note/message field for reason for interest, prerequisites completed, expected release date, or other context for admin

## Button States

The action button for each program should display different states:

-   **"Send Kite" (enabled)**: Resident has never requested this program and is not enrolled
-   **"Pending" (pill/disabled)**: Resident has sent a kite that hasn't been approved or denied yet
-   **"Enrolled" (pill/disabled)**: Resident is already enrolled in this program

## Business Rules

-   Resident can send kites for multiple programs simultaneously
-   Resident cannot send duplicate kites for the same program (button disabled if kite is pending)
-   Resident cannot send kite for programs they're already enrolled in (button disabled/replaced)
-   No limit on number of programs a resident can request

## Confirmation

-   Immediate confirmation message displayed when kite is successfully sent

## Notes

-   Program list comes from existing programs in the system (same programs admins manage)
-   This is the resident's self-service equivalent to the traditional paper kite system
