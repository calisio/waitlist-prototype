# Resident receives notification when added to waitlist

## Description

Resident receives an in-app notification when an admin approves their kite and adds them to a program's waitlist, informing them of their new waitlist status and position.

## Notification System

-   In-app notifications only (no email/SMS in MVP)
-   Notifications displayed on dedicated notifications page/inbox
-   Notifications are not immediate - populated when resident visits the page (when DB is queried)

## Notification Content

The notification should state:

-   "You have been added to the waitlist for [Program Name]. You are #[Position] on the waitlist."

Example: "You have been added to the waitlist for GED Program. You are #12 on the waitlist."

## Special Case: Direct Approval from Pending State

If admin approves a kite that was still in "Pending" state (skipped confirmation), resident receives **two separate notifications**:

1. "Your kite for [Program Name] has been acknowledged by an administrator"
2. "You have been added to the waitlist for [Program Name]. You are #[Position] on the waitlist."

Both notifications appear as distinct entries in the notifications inbox.

## User Experience

-   Resident navigates to notifications page to view notification
-   No manual marking as read/unread in MVP
-   No visual distinction between new and viewed notifications in MVP
-   All notifications appear with same styling
-   No actions required from resident (informational only)

## Business Rules

-   Notification created when admin approves kite and adds resident to waitlist
-   Position number reflects resident's current position at time of notification creation
-   Notifications do not expire or get archived
-   Notifications persist indefinitely

## Notes

-   Provides confirmation that kite was not only received but acted upon
-   Transparency about waitlist position helps manage expectations
-   Part of trust-building to replace opaque paper system

## Future Enhancements

-   Auto-mark notifications as viewed when scrolled into viewport
-   New notifications appear highlighted/bold, viewed notifications appear regular/gray
-   Link to view current waitlist position (may have changed since notification)
